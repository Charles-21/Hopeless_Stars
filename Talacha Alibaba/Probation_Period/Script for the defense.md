**Greetings**

Good morning, everyone. It’s a pleasure to meet you — I hope you’re all doing well.

I’ll and share my screen so you can follow my presentation.  
Let me know once you can see it, please — could someone please confirm?

My name is Charles, and as you may already know, I have been working here over the past two months.

Today I’m excited to share with you a brief overview of what I have done during my probation period, what I’ve learned, and how I intend to keep contributing to our team’s growth.

**Self introduction**

As I said before, my name is Charles, and I belong to the Axolotl team, based in Mexico City.

I completed a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics and Mathematics.
Previously, I worked as a **teaching assistant** at my university, delivering lessons in **astrophysics** and **advanced mathematics**. I also worked as a **metrology apprentice** in a **calibration lab specialized in scales and balances**, where I learned the importance of precision and rigorous standards.
 
I’ve also gained valuable experience in **customer service**, having worked in my family’s coffee shop since I was a child. That role helped me develop empathy, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility toward others.
 
On the technical side, I’m confident working with programming languages such as **Python**, **Julia**, and **Fortran**, and I’m very comfortable using **Linux environments**, especially Debian and Fedora.
 
I’ve also worked with **data analysis and business tools**, including **Power BI**, **Power Apps**, and **Power Automate**, developing internal tools and automated workflows.
 
In addition, I have experience in **scientific computing**, particularly in **numerical simulations** and **differential equation modeling**, which has helped me build efficient, data-driven solutions.

I believe this combination of **scientific training**, **technical skills**, and **hands-on customer experience** allows me to approach problems with both a logical mindset and a strong focus on people’s needs.

**Personal KPI result during the probation period**

Now I’d like to show you the **key performance indicators** from my probation period.

As you can see, during these two months, my **Satisfaction Rate** was **88.89%**, which is higher than the team average of 84.51%.

My **Days to Solve (DTS)** was **0.48** (Zero point four eight), compared to the team average of 0.70

In terms of **First Day Resolution (FDR)**, I reached **77.42%** , above the team average. This suggests that most of the time, I’ve been able to solve issues effectively on the first try.

Even though the **ticket volume** I have handled is lower — which is expected, since I’m still new — I’ve focused on quality, precision, and learning as much as possible with every case.

I also kept my number of **bad satisfaction tickets** to just one, and I am continue working to reduce this indicator.

Overall, I believe these numbers reflect a positive start and a strong foundation to keep growing and contributing to the team.

In the following graphs, I’m showing three key performance indicators that cover the three months of my probation period.

As you can see, the **Satisfaction Rate** has increased.

The **FDR**, or First-time Delivery Rate, has also improved over time, showing better issue resolution on the first reply.

This graph for the DTS along this three months

These trends give me confidence that I’m on the right path, and I’ll keep working to maintain and improve these results moving forward.

**Two Sample Ticket with the most impressive progress**

Now I will show two tickets with the most impressive progress

In this case, the customer asked: _“How to create an ACS Cluster using Terraform?”_ Although this specific technical topic was not covered during my training, I took the initiative to investigate the official documentation and found a relevant guide titled _“Create an ACK managed cluster by using Terraform.”_

I asked the customer if this was what he was referring to and shared the result of my research. Additionally, I informed him that if his question was not fully resolved, I would be happy to escalate the case to the specialized team.

The customer then closed the ticket and left a positive review.

In this second case, the customer wanted to know if there was any way to recover their data, since their **Simple Application Server** subscription had already expired.

I took the time to research the official documentation and found the relevant details regarding this situation.  
Then I explained the scenario to the customer in a clear and friendly way, helping them understand what had happened and what options were available. I also provided the appropriate documentation for their reference.

Shortly after, the customer expressed their gratitude, closed the ticket, and left a positive review with the tag:

- _“User-friendly Product Interface.”_

From this ticket I want to highlight the use of emojis to make my interaction with the customer more didactic and friendly.

From both of these experiences, I learned the importance of providing accurate, well-sourced information, and of choosing the right words to make the customer feel heard, supported, and well attended.

**Personal Action Plan about performance improvement or maintenance in future**

In this section, I’d like to share some of the actions I plan to take in order to improve and maintain high performance moving forward.

First, I want to focus on refining my communication skills — especially in writing — to ensure that customers feel truly supported, understood, and valued. I will be studying what makes a message not only informative, but also empathetic and reassuring.

I also intend to go deeper into the official documentation, and review past tickets to identify areas where I can improve my approach or better understand cases I haven’t encountered yet.

Another key point is staying in close contact with my supervisor to understand the team’s priorities, and to be available where I’m most needed. For example, if data shows a pattern of high ticket volume at specific times, I’d be willing to adjust my schedule accordingly to better support the team.

Finally, I’ll stay flexible and open to feedback, always ready to adapt to any new challenges or improvements the team needs.

**Finish**

That concludes my presentation. Thank you very much for your time. I’m open to any suggestions or questions you might have.
