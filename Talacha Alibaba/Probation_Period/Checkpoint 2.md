I have written answers in italics as if I were responding to a customer's request.

1. I want to register a .com domain name, how should I proceed? Is there any document that I can refer to?

	_Dear Customer,_
	
	_Welcome to Alibaba Cloud International Support, I'm delighted to be of service!_
	
	_To register a .com domain name on Alibaba Cloud, you must first create a **domain name registrant profile** and complete **real-name verification**. Once verified, you can proceed with registering the domain._
	
	_If the domain will be **used in Mainland China**, you are required to apply for an **ICP Filing** (Internet Content Provider Filing). This is a legal requirement for all websites hosted in China. You can submit your ICP filing application through the **Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing Management System**._
	
	_For more information, you can refer to the official documentation:_
	
	[Alibaba Cloud Domain Registration Guide](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/dws/product-overview/what-is-domains?spm=a2c63.p38356.help-menu-35473.d_0_0_0.286f1413237yJB&scm=20140722.H_61257._.OR_help-T_intl~en-V_1)
	
	_If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me — I’ll make sure to respond as quickly as possible._
	
	_Best Regards,_
	
	_Alibaba Cloud International Support_

	According to what I understand, ICP Filing only applies if the content (website, app, etc.) is hosted on servers within mainland China.

<span style="color:green"> Q1: only for .cn suffix domain name need to create CNNIC template and complete domain real name registration. For .com domain, complete general template and get email verified with email.

Furthermore, domain name registered in International site not supported to do ICP filling. </span>

2. I want to transfer my domain name from one Alibaba Chinese station account to my international station account. How should I transfer? Is there any document that I can refer to?

	It is NOT posible :(
	
	Citing the documentation: "Is it possible to transfer domain names between accounts? Yes... note that transfers are only supported between accounts within the same site... **Domain name transfers between the Chinese site and the international site, or between international sites and the Chinese site, are not supported**..."

	_Dear Alibaba Cloud customer,_
	
	_I regret to inform you that transfers are only supported between accounts within the same site. In other words, it is only supported to transfer domain names from one international site account to another international site account. So domain name transfers between the Chinese site and the international site, or between international sites and the Chinese site, are not supported._
	
	_Thank you very much for your understanding and sorry for any inconvenience this causes._
	
	_If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me — I’ll make sure to respond as quickly as possible._
	
	_Best Regards,_

3. I am unable to activate my direct mail, can you please check?
	
	In this situation, it is most likely one of the following two possibilities:
	
	- Risk Control: Please submit KYC (Know Your Customer) information.
	- Indian customers: Paytm account is not bound.
	
	With the UID, I would go to the appropriate tool to determine if it is a KYC issue. If so, I would respond accordingly.
	
	Likewise, I can determine the account's country of origin and thus determine if it is from India.
	
	If the situation doesn't fit either of the above two scenarios, I would escalate the ticket.

4. How should I configure my domain name in direct mail service? Any document I can refer to?

	_Dear Customer,_
	
	_Greetings! Welcome to Alibaba Cloud International Support_
	
	_You can configure your domain name for use with the Direct Mail service using two available methods:_
	
	1. _**Automatic Configuration** – Recommended if your domain meets certain criteria (e.g., it is registered under the same Alibaba Cloud account used for Direct Mail and is not involved in other enterprise scenarios)._
	    
	2. _**Manual Configuration** – If automatic setup is not possible, you can manually add the necessary DNS records (TXT, MX, and CNAME) through your domain provider's DNS management page._
	    	
	_For your convenience, you can refer to the official documentation for a step-by-step guide:_
	[How to Configure Sending Domain Names](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/direct-mail/user-guide/how-to-configure-sending-domain-names)
