**_3D verification_**

Dear customer,

Welcome to Alibaba Cloud International Support!  
I'm delighted to assist you. My name is Charles, and I’ll be handling your ticket. 😊

When you set a bank card as your preferred external payment method, Alibaba Cloud may require you to complete a 3D verification process.

You can find the notification from Alibaba Cloud in the Message Center or in your registered email. Simply click the link provided in the message and follow the instructions to complete the 3D verification.

Once the 3D verification is complete, please return to the Payment Methods page and set the bank card as your preferred external payment method.

Please note: if the order is currently in "Unpaid" status, it cannot be paid again. Unpaid orders are only valid for 15 minutes.  
To proceed, cancel the pending order from the link below and try placing the payment again:

🔗 https://usercenter2-intl.aliyun.com/order/list?pageIndex=1&pageSize=20

The payment failure you’re experiencing is typically caused by an incomplete payment process. Kindly ensure that 3D verification is completed successfully during payment, and that each payment attempt is finalized properly.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out — I’ll respond as quickly as possible to support you. 🧑‍💻

If your phone does not successfully receive the verification code, we recommend that you try the following methods to solve the problem:

- Check if the phone has not been restarted for a long time. You can try to turn off and restart the phone.
    
- Check if the SMS inbox of the phone is full. Try to delete some SMS to see if you can receive a new verification code.
    
- If you are using a dual-SIM phone, try to change the SIM card to another card slot.
    
- Check if the phone has security software installed that may intercept SMS.
    
- If the above methods do not solve the problem, try to test the SIM card in another phone.
    

If your mailbox does not receive the verification code, we recommend that you try the following methods to solve the problem:

- Please check if the email has been placed in the spam folder.
    
- Please add the sending address system-sg@notice.alibabacloud.com to your mailbox whitelist and then resend the email.

**_Template mamalón de Emi para gente que no hizo respaldo_**

Dear Customer,

Thank you for reaching out and I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Here’s what happened and how we can resolve it:

📌 What Occurred

According to our billing and instance lifecycle policy:

When a pay‑as‑you‑go ECS instance fails to meet payment requests for 15 days after suspension, it is automatically released, and all associated data (disks, snapshots, configurations) is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered

That´s why you're unable to restart or access your instance

⚙ Recovery Options

If You Have Backups/Snapshots:

You can restore a new ECS instance from any existing snapshots or Cloud Backups

[https://docs-aliyun.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/pdf/ecs-Pricing-intl-en-2017-06-19.pdf](https://docs-aliyun.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/pdf/ecs-Pricing-intl-en-2017-06-19.pdf)

Use the Cloud Backup console → select your backup → choose “Clone” or “Restore” to create a fresh instance.

If No Backups Are Available

-You’ll need to recreate the instance from scratch, reinstall software, and redeploy your application.

-While inconvenient, this will restore your workspace with a clean slate.

🔧 How to Prevent This in Future

Maintain sufficient account balance or use auto-renewal/subscription billing so services aren’t suspended due to non-payment

Enable Cloud Backup or schedule snapshots regularly to ensure recoverability

✅ Next Steps for You

1.Check for existing snapshots or backups in your ECS or Cloud Backup console.

2. If backups exist, restore your instance from them.

3. If not, create a fresh ECS instance and set it up again.

4.Consider enabling auto-renewal and a backup strategy.

If you have any other question just ask me and I will answer you in the fastest way for you

Remember at the finish of the ticket select solved and you'll have the opportunity to evaluate our service,

Please leave us a good and solved review.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.
