**Empathy**

Dear Alibaba Cloud Customer,  
  
I am really sorry that this matter may bring you a disappointing experience. I have been in your position sometimes when I could not use any method of payment. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  
  
But at the moment, the only accepted payment methods for customers in Russia are physical cards from VISA and Mastercard. Unfortunately, no alternative payment methods have been enabled for Russia at this time.  
  
We understand that this may be inconvenient, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to explore additional payment options if they are possible in the future.  
  
Your patience and consideration are very important to us. Thank you.  
  
Unortunately this may take some time. If there is anything else that I can help you with, please let me know I will be more than happy to assist you.  
  
Thanks a lot for using Ali Cloud Services  
  
Best regards,
